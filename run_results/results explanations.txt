2. with bias, 5000 episodes, 2000 steps, 
3. same as above, except recording rewards
4. same parameters except with 10000 episodes
5.same as above, 2500 episodes, discount gamma = .5
6. changed reward function to ignore the done case for the half portruded state, 
added a proportinality gain to the bias terms, and added a restrciton of zero rewards when the blocks below and above good push block are moved
7.increased the envelope in for the done case in the x direction
8. removed the bias term only gaining, +1 if it pushes the block over
9. removed bias term and made it such that the NN learns over all 4000 iterations, or done case (larger epochs)
