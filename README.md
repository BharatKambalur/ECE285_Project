## Setup

To ensure correct models are present for Pybullet, please copy the contents of the `data` folder to your `pybullet3/data` directory.

## Training

To train your own model, run 'ddqn.py'. Please update the Pybullet path to the correct destination. Also, to save the model, uncomment the model that says "agent.save('<model_name>')"
update pybulletPath and outputpath


## Testing the Trained Model

Run 'PolicyRolloutTest.py' to test the learned model. Ensure correct paths are updated before doing so.
